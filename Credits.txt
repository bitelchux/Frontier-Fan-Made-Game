== Sounds ==

The plasma sound effect is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myAmiHOyoLo
The first part of the in-game music is from either Limitless or Elektronima, I'm not sure which.
The second part is from http://newgrounds.com and the menu music also is.
The sound effects are made using https://www.bfxr.net/ by theChaotic (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/theChAOTiC/).
The original game is here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/58976080

== Programming ==

I used phaser (https://phaser.io) to create the game but phaser wouldn't be possible without pixi.js (http://www.pixijs.com/)
I used JAMESCRIPT to make it even easier to create my game which I created (https://github.com/hedgehog125/JAMESCRIPT) but to make 
it I had quite a few bits and pieces of help from stackoverflow questions. (I wrote comments in my code where I got help)
The game JSON is all mine.

== Graphics ==

I painted all of the graphics myself using GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/).
Although, I had to look at other images to help me with mine (but who doesn't?)
